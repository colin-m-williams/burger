# Eat-Da-Burger

The tenth assignment for UNC Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, I made
Eat-Da-Burger!, a restaurant app that lets users input burgers they like to eat.

### Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out the app for yourself](burger_demo.mp4).
